<p>If you accepted the default settings when you configured your GitHub Enterprise instance, you should be using built-in authentication. All authentication details will be stored within your Enterprise instance, and users will have to sign up with a new username and password inside the installation. If you would prefer to use LDAP, CAS, or <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/">GitHub OAuth</a> instead, you can refer to the following articles:</p>

<ul>
<li>"<a href="/enterprise/11.10.340/admin/articles/about-ldap-authentication">About LDAP authentication</a>"</li>
<li>"<a href="/enterprise/11.10.340/admin/articles/about-cas-authentication">About CAS authentication</a>"</li>
<li>"<a href="/enterprise/11.10.340/admin/articles/about-github-oauth">About GitHub OAuth</a>"</li>
</ul>

<p>For simplicity's sake, let's assume that you are using built-in authentication. When you sign in for the first time, you will see the following screen prompting you to create an admin user account. (You will actually be prompted to do this <em>even if</em> you use another authentication method.)</p>
